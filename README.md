Autonomous Thermal Agents in LEO: Architecting the First Data Centers in the Universe

Transitioning to the space-based Artificial Intelligence infrastructure reveals a critical 'Thermal Wall.'
Legacy cooling—reliant on toxic dielectrics and mechanistic defiance—is unsustainable in the orbit.
My research focuses on a Regenerative Thermal Architecture powered by Databricks Agent Bricks.
I propose a shift toward Integrated Thermal Autonomy, using a biocompatible, non-toxic coolant woven directly into the hardware fabric.

By designing for in-situ resource utilization, I explore sustaining life and economy in the Universe.
This infrastructure establishes the groundwork for symbiotic resource cycles that eventually benefit and protect our home planet.
I develop self-healing, regenerative systems that collaborate with the orbital environment.
I will demonstrate an autonomous 'Survival Instinct' logic that predicts solar flux shocks to ensure mission resilience.
Join me as I architect the regenerative thermal systems necessary to sustain planetary intelligence among the stars.

📊 Simulation: Predictive Thermal Autonomy
This repository contains a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating the Survival Instinct logic for orbital compute nodes.

Core Logic
Unlike legacy systems that react to hardware temperature spikes (reactive), this Agent Brick logic utilizes predictive modulation (proactive).
It monitors solar flux intensity in real-time and adjusts the regenerative thermal fabric's flow rate before the hardware reaches critical thermal thresholds.

Key Metrics
Baseline Flux: 1361 W/m² (Solar Constant)
Response Trigger: 1.1x - 1.3x Flux Spike
Safety Mechanism: Regenerative Shielding Mode (1.8x coolant modulation)
Goal: Preventing the "Thermal Wall" in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environments.
