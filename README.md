Autonomous Thermal Agents in LEO: Architecting the First Data Centers in the Universe

Transitioning to the space-based Artificial Intelligence infrastructure reveals a critical 'Thermal Wall.'
Legacy cooling—reliant on toxic dielectrics and mechanistic defiance—is unsustainable in the orbit.
My research focuses on a Regenerative Thermal Architecture powered by Databricks Agent Bricks.
I propose a shift toward Integrated Thermal Autonomy, using a biocompatible, non-toxic coolant woven directly into the hardware fabric.

By designing for in-situ resource utilization, I explore sustaining life and economy in the Universe.
This infrastructure establishes the groundwork for symbiotic resource cycles that eventually benefit and protect our home planet.
I develop self-healing, regenerative systems that collaborate with the orbital environment.
I will demonstrate an autonomous 'Survival Instinct' logic that predicts solar flux shocks to ensure mission resilience.
Join me as I architect the regenerative thermal systems necessary to sustain planetary intelligence among the stars.
